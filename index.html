        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current college freshman at UCR. I graduated from high school with the Seal of Biliteracy and the Golden State Merit Seal. <br><br>

        Growing up, I was always given the idea that I was able to accomplish what I dreamt I could do knowing that I always had the support of my parents. I always had this kind of mindset as I ventured into middle school then high school. As I took this journey, I was never much of a social person growing up. Not to indicate that I had no friends but I did have some close friends who would I knew I could trust to always have my back. As time went on, I grew as a person and with that, my knowledge of the world. I really never saw this as a bad thing and more of a sign that I was maturing. Come high school, that's when I hit my all time high in terms of academics. I was acing most of my exams and semester finals. However, when it came to the AP exams, I did struggle a little there, receiving some 2s. Not one of my proudest moments but perhaps my proudest moment was receiving a 5 on my AP Spanish exam.<br><br>

        From there, I knew that I would be able to accomplish what I wanted at that time. And so I did. In June of 2022, I graduated high school with a big old smile on my face. I was in my proudest moment at that time. Looking back on that, there's so much more that I could've done to better myself but there would be no point in looking back on that right? My father always says to me that "what had happened in the past happened already. What you need to do is focus on today and then we'll see what happens tomorrow." I always take those words to heart and always focus on what's happening today and then wait to see what will happen tomorrow. As of today, I'm currently satisfied with where I am right now. I could focus on what might happen tomorrow or next week, but then I lose focus of today which is my main priority.
